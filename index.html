	<h1>Hi there, I'm Cem.</h1>
	<a href="CemLinkedIn.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="CemLinkedIn.jpg" alt=""></a>
	<p>I'm a PhD Candidate from the <a href="https://www.esi-frankfurt.de/research/vinck-lab/">Vinck Lab, ESI</a>. </p>
	
	<p>I am currently working at Ernst Str√ºngmann Institute (ESI) for Neuroscience in Cooperation with Max Planck Society as a graduate student supervised by Dr.Martin Vinck. I am interested in applying computational approaches as well as theory from electronics and computer science (signals and systems, control, information theory) to discover underlying neural phenomena. I am focused in computational modeling of visual areas of mammals and dynamical modeling of the cortical layers using large-scale electrophysiology recordings and closed-loop optogenetic stimulation.</p>

	<p>I did my Masters in computer science at the Univesity of Freiburg. My thesis work entitled "Source localization of high-density microelectrode array recordings" is an interdisciplinary work of the 3D Image Analysis Group and Computational Neuroscience Center, Bernstein Center Freiburg.</p>

	<p>The thesis is a method in source localization of neuronal activity for high-density micro-electrode array recordings. It is focused on Nonlinear Optimization, Modelling and Applied Mathematics, Neural Signal Processing.</p>

	<p>I majored in Cognitive Technical Systems, and during my studies I've been focused in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Brain State Decoding, Brain Machine Interfaces, Electrical stimulation, EEG Signal Analysis.</p>
